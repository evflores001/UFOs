# UFOs and JavaScript
---

## Overview of the analysis:
---

The purpose of this challenges was to create an interactive webpage using javascript, css, and html. Working upon the javascript file created throughout the module, additional search filters were added which include date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO sighting.

## Results:
---

The event listener used within the app.js file awaits a "change" to occur within the filters created. These changes can be either when a user inputs values into the search input field and clicks ENTER or TAB.

The following images are include an unfiltered table and a table after filters have been applied, respectively:

![]() ![]()

## Summary:

### Drawbacks
One drawback from this webpage is that the data used has to be formatted a very specific way and thus limits the amount/sources of data.

### Recommendations
One recommendation for further development of this webpage would be to integrate an export feature that would allow the filtered table to be downloaded, preferrably as a csv file.

Another would be to inlcude an optional user input-field that would allow privileged users to add entries into the table.
